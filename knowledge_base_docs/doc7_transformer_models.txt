Transformer Models in AI

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture introduced in 2017 that revolutionized natural language processing. They use attention mechanisms to process sequences of data.

Key Innovation: Self-Attention
- Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input when processing each element
- Enables parallel processing (unlike RNNs which process sequentially)
- Captures long-range dependencies effectively

Architecture Components:
- Encoder: Processes input sequences
- Decoder: Generates output sequences
- Attention Layers: Determine which parts of input to focus on
- Feed-Forward Networks: Process attended information

Famous Models:
- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations (understanding)
- GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (generation)
- T5: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer
- Vision Transformers: Applied to computer vision tasks

Transformers have become the foundation for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Claude.
