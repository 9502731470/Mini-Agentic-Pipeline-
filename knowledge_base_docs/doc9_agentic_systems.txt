Agentic AI Systems

Agentic AI systems are AI agents that can autonomously plan, execute actions, and achieve goals. Unlike simple chatbots, they can use tools, make decisions, and operate in dynamic environments.

Key Components:
1. Planning: Breaking down goals into steps
2. Tool Use: Interacting with external systems (APIs, databases, web)
3. Memory: Maintaining context across interactions
4. Reflection: Evaluating and improving actions

Architecture Patterns:
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): Interleaves reasoning and action
- Reflexion: Adds self-reflection to improve performance
- Tool-Using Agents: Can call functions/APIs
- Multi-Agent Systems: Multiple agents collaborating

Use Cases:
- Research assistants that search and synthesize information
- Code generation agents that write and test code
- Customer service agents that access databases
- Autonomous research and development

Challenges: Error handling, safety, cost management, and ensuring reliable execution.
