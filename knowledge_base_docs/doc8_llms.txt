Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. They represent a significant advancement in natural language processing.

Characteristics:
- Trained on billions or trillions of parameters
- Pre-trained on diverse internet text
- Can be fine-tuned for specific tasks
- Exhibit emergent capabilities at scale

Capabilities:
- Text generation and completion
- Question answering
- Translation between languages
- Code generation and explanation
- Summarization
- Creative writing
- Reasoning and problem-solving

Popular LLMs:
- GPT-4 (OpenAI): General-purpose, multimodal
- Claude (Anthropic): Focus on safety and helpfulness
- LLaMA (Meta): Open-source models
- Gemini (Google): Multimodal capabilities

Challenges: Hallucination, bias, computational costs, environmental impact, and need for careful prompt engineering.
