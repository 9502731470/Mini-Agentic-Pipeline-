Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

Architecture:
- Input Layer: Receives the initial data
- Hidden Layers: Process the data through weighted connections
- Output Layer: Produces the final result

Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers (hence "deep"). Popular architectures include:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data
- Transformers for natural language processing

Training involves:
1. Forward propagation: Data flows through the network
2. Loss calculation: Compare output with expected result
3. Backpropagation: Adjust weights to minimize error
4. Iteration: Repeat until model converges

Applications: Image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles.
