Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective inputs (prompts) to get desired outputs from LLMs. Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve model performance.

Key Techniques:
1. Clear Instructions: Be specific about what you want
2. Few-Shot Learning: Provide examples in the prompt
3. Chain-of-Thought: Ask model to show reasoning steps
4. Role-Playing: Assign a role to the model
5. Format Specification: Request structured outputs (JSON, XML)
6. Iterative Refinement: Refine prompts based on results

Prompt Patterns:
- Zero-shot: Direct question without examples
- Few-shot: Include examples of desired behavior
- Chain-of-Thought: "Let's think step by step"
- ReAct: "Reasoning: ... Action: ..."
- Tree of Thoughts: Explore multiple reasoning paths

Best Practices:
- Be explicit and specific
- Use delimiters for clarity
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Specify output format
- Include constraints and requirements
- Test and iterate on prompts

Tools: LangChain, LlamaIndex, PromptLayer for prompt management and versioning.
