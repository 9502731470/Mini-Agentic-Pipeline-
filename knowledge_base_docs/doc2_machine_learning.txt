Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled training data (e.g., classification, regression)
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties

Common Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- K-Means Clustering

ML is used in recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, and predictive analytics.
