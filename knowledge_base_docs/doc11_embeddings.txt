Text Embeddings

Text embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Similar texts have similar embeddings, enabling semantic search and similarity calculations.

How Embeddings Work:
- Text is converted to dense numerical vectors (typically 384, 512, or 1536 dimensions)
- Similarity is measured using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance
- Embeddings capture semantic relationships, not just word matching

Embedding Models:
- OpenAI: text-embedding-3-small, text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-ada-002
- Sentence Transformers: Open-source models optimized for embeddings
- BERT-based: Domain-specific embeddings

Use Cases:
- Semantic search: Find documents by meaning, not keywords
- Clustering: Group similar documents
- Recommendation systems: Find similar items
- Anomaly detection: Identify outliers
- RAG systems: Retrieve relevant context

Best Practices:
- Use appropriate embedding model for your domain
- Normalize embeddings for better similarity calculations
- Consider dimensionality vs. performance trade-offs
- Fine-tune embeddings for domain-specific tasks if needed
