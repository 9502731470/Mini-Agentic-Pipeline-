Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.

Key Tasks:
- Tokenization: Breaking text into words or sentences
- Part-of-Speech Tagging: Identifying grammatical roles
- Named Entity Recognition: Identifying people, places, organizations
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining emotional tone
- Machine Translation: Translating between languages
- Question Answering: Answering questions from text
- Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries

Modern NLP uses transformer models like BERT, GPT, and T5. These models are pre-trained on large text corpora and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Applications: Chatbots, virtual assistants, language translation, content moderation, information extraction.
