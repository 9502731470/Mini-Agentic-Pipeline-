Vector Databases

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) efficiently. They enable fast similarity search for AI applications.

Key Features:
- Efficient similarity search using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms
- Scalability to millions or billions of vectors
- Metadata filtering alongside vector search
- Real-time updates and queries

Popular Vector Databases:
- ChromaDB: Lightweight, embedded, Python-first
- Pinecone: Managed cloud service
- Weaviate: Open-source with GraphQL API
- Qdrant: High-performance, written in Rust
- Milvus: Scalable open-source solution
- FAISS: Facebook's library for efficient similarity search

Use Cases:
- RAG systems: Store document embeddings
- Recommendation engines: Find similar items
- Image search: Visual similarity matching
- Anomaly detection: Find unusual patterns
- Semantic search: Search by meaning

Query Types:
- Similarity search: Find most similar vectors
- Hybrid search: Combine vector and keyword search
- Filtered search: Apply metadata filters
- Batch queries: Process multiple queries efficiently
