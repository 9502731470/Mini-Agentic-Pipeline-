Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview

Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

Key Concepts:
- Machine Learning: A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data without being explicitly programmed
- Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers
- Natural Language Processing: AI's ability to understand and process human language
- Computer Vision: AI's ability to interpret and understand visual information

Applications of AI include autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, language translation, recommendation systems, and game playing.
