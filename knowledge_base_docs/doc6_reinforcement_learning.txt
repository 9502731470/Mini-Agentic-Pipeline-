Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.

Key Components:
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: The world the agent interacts with
- Actions: What the agent can do
- States: Current situation of the environment
- Rewards: Feedback from the environment
- Policy: Strategy the agent uses to determine actions

Learning Process:
1. Agent observes current state
2. Agent selects action based on policy
3. Environment transitions to new state
4. Agent receives reward
5. Agent updates policy based on reward

Popular Algorithms:
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Methods

Applications: Game playing (AlphaGo, Chess), robotics, autonomous systems, recommendation systems, resource management.
