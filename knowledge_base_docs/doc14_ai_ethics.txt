AI Ethics and Responsible AI

As AI systems become more powerful and widespread, ethical considerations are crucial for responsible development and deployment.

Key Ethical Concerns:

2. Privacy: Handling of personal data and surveillance concerns
3. Transparency: Understanding how AI makes decisions (explainability)
4. Accountability: Who is responsible for AI decisions
5. Safety: Ensuring AI systems don't cause harm
6. Job Displacement: Impact on employment
7. Misinformation: AI-generated false information

Principles of Responsible AI:

- Inclusiveness: Accessible to all
- Transparency: Clear about capabilities and limitations
- Accountability: Clear responsibility for outcomes

Mitigation Strategies:
