Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG is a technique that enhances LLM responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers. This addresses LLM limitations like outdated knowledge and hallucinations.

How RAG Works:
1. Query Processing: User question is received
2. Retrieval: Relevant documents retrieved from knowledge base using embeddings
3. Augmentation: Retrieved context added to LLM prompt
4. Generation: LLM generates answer using both its training and retrieved context

Benefits:
- Access to up-to-date information
- Reduced hallucinations
- Ability to cite sources
- Domain-specific knowledge integration
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning

Components:
- Vector Database: Stores document embeddings (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone)
- Embedding Model: Converts text to vectors (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)
- LLM: Generates final answer
- Retriever: Finds relevant documents

Applications: Enterprise knowledge bases, customer support, research assistants, documentation systems.
