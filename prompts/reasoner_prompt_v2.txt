Return ONLY this JSON:

{
  "needs_tool": false,
  "tool_name": "none",
  "tool_query": "",
  "reasoning": "<why KB was enough>",
  "confidence": "high"
}

If KB DOES NOT contain the answer:
Return ONLY this JSON:

{
  "needs_tool": true,
  "tool_name": "csv_lookup",
  "tool_query": "<the product or keyword to search>",
  "reasoning": "<why KB is insufficient>",
  "confidence": "medium"
}
